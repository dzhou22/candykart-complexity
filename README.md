# How hard is a video game?
### Dylan Zhou, CS 121 Final Project

In class we learned to classify the complexity of many problems, including ones involving scheduling, graph-coloring, and satisfiability of boolean formulas. What if we applied the same techniques to analyze video games? In my project, I found two currently popular games from the App Store, Candy Crush and Mario Kart Tour, and prove their how hard they are. 

Initially I planned to analyze three video games (third one was Monument Valley), but figuring out reductions for Candy Crush and Mario Kart Tour, plus creating animations and recording narration took much much longer than expected, so I only present two proofs.

They can be found at the following links:

(If the above links do not work, here are the URLs: https://youtu.be/bpSBCFDPoXw, https://youtu.be/zjr-0HhHWHM.)

To start, I downloaded the games and played them for a while to get to know their rules. For reductions, I consulted papers on similar games and these particular games for inspiration. I then learned the `manim` python package, used by the YouTube channel 3blue1brown, and created animations for the proofs. I also recorded my voice explaining the steps of each proof. I used Final Cut Pro to edit and piece things together. My resources and animation code are in the description of the YouTube videos.

(My code is in the `candycrush` and `mariokart` folders. Other files are from `3b1b`.)
